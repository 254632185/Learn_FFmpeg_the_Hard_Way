## Sample calculation of audio file size - audio file size calculator

1. Sample Rate (Hz): The number of samples taken per second (e.g., 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz).
2. Bit Depth: The number of bits used to represent each sample (e.g., 16-bit, 24-bit).
3. Number of Channels: Typically 1 for mono, 2 for stereo.
4. The formula for calculating the uncompressed audio file size in bytes is:

> Audio file size = bit depth * sample rate * duration of audio * number of channels (bits)

### Example Calculation
For a 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo (2 channels) audio file of 1 minute (60 seconds):

> Audio file size = 44100 × 16 × 2 × 60 / 8 = 10,584,000 bytes = 10.1 MB
