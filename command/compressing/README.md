# Compress/Rescale Videos/Images using FFmpeg

## Images

> Images are nothing but videos with just one frame. This is the reason why most of the video commands are applicable here as well.

* For example, to compress an image to a lower resolution, say 1080p, use the following command:

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT.jpg -filter:v scale=-2:1080 OUTPUT.jpg     
```

or 

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT.jpg -filter:v scale=1920:1080 OUTPUT.jpg   
```

* The above command will reduce the file size, but the visual quality will also be reduced. To prevent such reduction, use the FFmpegâ€™s default settings i.e. no need to supply any flags:

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT.jpg  -compression_level 50 OUTPUT.jpg 
```

or

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT.jpg  -qscale:v 2 OUTPUT.jpg 
```
